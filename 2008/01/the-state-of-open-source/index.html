            <h2>The state of Open Source</h2>

  <p>The state of open source seems better than ever some would say, so here is my opinion on the past and present. In 2007 Linux made a great push for the low cost PC market and a PC manufacturer (DELL) began selling Linux on desktops as an alternative to Windows after all they have been offering Linux on servers for a long time. Linux on desktops and laptops seems to be one of the best ways to introduce the general public to Open Source. Another highlight that got me exited was the use of Linux on mobile devices ranging from mobile phones to internet oriented devices specifically the Nokia N Internet Tablet series (N800 successor to the N770 ), Motorola also released the RAZR 2 the second to use a Linux based platform (Z6 was first). The released of the ASUS eee (now renamed) which in my opinion attempts the position it self between a smart phone and laptop while also bring along a keyboard and reduction on size not to mention the price. For those who love touch screens more than keys or the other way, well now you have options. Who in the world of Open Source didn‚Äôt hear about the OLPC a technology oriented initiative aimed to help kids learn in the developing world. Regardless of what everybody says I support this project because its a new attempt to help people gain skills, countries need technology to develop. This type of project has the ability to bring Open Source to the younger generation and build a user base where there was none. Open Source can start from scratch and see how it holds. One of Open Source greatest products is Linux (among others) and that‚Äôs the most notable offering to the world. Dependency can lead conformism don‚Äôt get me wrong there is a huge number of distributions out there with support from individuals and companies but name one project that‚Äôs not an OS or server oriented out there maybe cross platform with the same support and marketing (if any) or user base that gets close to Linux. Maybe we are trying to take big steps by changing the operating system first or maybe not. Just keep in mind that I am referring to the average user. Linux will always remain some what cryptic to the rest of the world because of the amount of choices offered, sometimes having too many choices can lead to confusion that‚Äôs not a bad thing after all because its the job of the community including my self to answer any questions. Of course I missed some other great devices running Linux out there but I wrote about what came to my mind first. I only have one huge disappointment there was no toaster with network capabilities that also runs Linux, a man can only dream. PS : I am still waiting for a George Foreman grill powered via USB (even if its proprietary).</p>
