She was admitted a coupe of days prior to her death to the hospital because of an infection, her condition only worsen ending in a fatal heart attack. The saddest part of the whole story is that she was next on the list to receive a kidney transplant. It was hard to hold my tears, after all it was a precious life with dreams and hopes for the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SLE (lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body’s normal immune system response. Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from harmful substances. But in patients with an autoimmune disease, the immune system can’t tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. The result is an overactive immune response that attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissue. This leads to chronic (long-term) inflammation..</p>

<p>Source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://health.google.com/health/ref/Systemic+lupus+erythematosus">Google Health</a> I was a witness of the struggle she and her family went through never giving up. The reason why I am writing this post is to appeal to the world and ask that if possible you help the family of my friend by lessening the financial burden. The family is of low income and they are having to hard time covering the funeral costs. Any amount will do just donate to help lessen the impact. You can donate by using the Chip In widget below. Rest assured that all the funds will go directly to the family.</p>
