We all know the threat of malware is constantly evolving, adapting and sooner or later a piece of malware is bound to slip past the anti-virus and cause damage. And by damage I am referring to rendering the system un-bootable or unstable to use. Meet <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.avg.com/us-en/avg-rescue-cd">AVG Rescue CD</a> a free bootable anti-virus solution by AVG and offered free of charge.

<h3 id="What-This-Means-For-You"><a href="#What-This-Means-For-You" class="headerlink" title="What This Means For You"></a>What This Means For You</h3><p>You gain the ability to work from a portable environment (Linux) without having to worry about the malware infecting the Live CD. Basically, Rescue CD is an Anti-virus on a Linux distro that is capable of scanning and update its definitions. The whole recovery process is easy to follow and requires no previous knowledge of Linux, only logic. Equally great is the fact that this tool is not limited to just AVG clients, AVG is nice enough to allow any one to download Rescue CD free of charge from their site. <em>Previously, I wrote about another Rescue CD solution by BitDefender while it did what it was supposed to do I no longer used it. I’ve replace it AVG Rescue CD due to the fact that it does not expire after a year and doesn’t require the user to register for a license(which is free).</em> <a href="http://linhost.info/2009/05/5-tools-that-should-be-part-of-any-malware-removal-toolkit/">5 tools that should be part of any malware removal toolkit</a></p>
