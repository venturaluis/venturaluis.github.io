<h4 id="My-Take"><a href="#My-Take" class="headerlink" title="My Take"></a>My Take</h4><p>For a free product Microsoft Security Essentials does an excellent job as an AV product that gets out of the users way and consumes little resources. With this in mind, Small Business usually do not employ on site staff and due to the low amount of users centralized administration may be an overkill. Also, it would not be far-off to consider Microsoft Security Essentials a stepping stone in to Microsoft business oriented AV solution <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.microsoft.com/forefront/en/us/default.aspx">Forefront</a> for those businesses that want more control.</p>

      <p>At home I have a pfSense firewall, the thing about my firewall is that I did a full installation on a Compact Flash card. Because, I want the benefits of a full installation like not loosing RRD graphs in case someone accidentally pulls the plug. The downside of using Compact Flash cards or Flash memory is the finite number of writes before wearing down and resulting in damaged sectors (unusable ones). The advantages of Flash memory are: <em>no moving parts, creates little heat, low power, and no noise</em>. This is why Flash memory is ideal for my needs, and I know of other full installs on Compact Flash cards that have worked for up to three years and even longer. <strong>You can take some precautions to reduce wear on a Compact Flash like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the embedded version of pfSense</li>
<li>With enough RAM the system may not have to use the swap partition at all.</li>
<li>Remove the swap partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it doens’t hurt to know that SLC Flash will last longer than MLC Flash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flash Cell Endurance: For Multi-Level Cell (MLC) Flash, up to 10,000 write cycles per physical sector. For Single-Level Cell (SLC) Flash, up to 100,000 write cycles per physical sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kingston.com/flash_memory_guide/">Kingston Flash Memory Guide</a> Because, I have 512MB of RAM in my Firewall which is more than enough, I did not remove the swap partition. Still, I worry about the finite number of writes on Flash memory, which prompted me to use badblocks. Badblocks is a tool capable of scanning a drive and report back on any damaged sectors it encounters. Modern drives can handle damaged sectors by seamlessly ignoring damaged sectors and only working with the remaining good sectors. This may sound great at first, but the truth is that the card is in the process of deteriorating(more to come) and the drive may need to be replaced.</p>
<h2 id="Tools-of-the-trade"><a href="#Tools-of-the-trade" class="headerlink" title="Tools of the trade"></a>Tools of the trade</h2><p>For this tutorial I will be using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://partedmagic.com/">Parted Magic</a> a Live distribution which includes badblocks. However, you will find badblocks on any Linux distributions. Also, make sure the target drive is unmounted before running badblocks. First you need the name of the drive you wish to scan, for this we can use <strong>lshw</strong> or Hardware Lister. The command is <strong>lshw -C disk</strong>.</p>
<p>root@PartedMagic:~# lshw -C disk<br>  *-disk<br>       description: ATA Disk<br>       product: ELITE PRO CF CAR<br>       physical id: 0.0.0<br>       bus info: scsi@2:0.0.0<br>       logical name: /dev/sda<br>       version: Ver3<br>       serial: 5B021A040<br>       size: 3639MiB (3816MB)<br>       capabilities: partitioned partitioned:dos<br>       configuration: ansiversion=5 signature=8f800000<br>  *-cdrom<br>       description: DVD reader<br>       physical id: 0.1.0<br>       bus info: scsi@3:0.1.0<br>       logical name: /dev/scd0<br>       logical name: /dev/sr0<br>       capabilities: audio dvd<br>       configuration: status=nodisc<br>  *-disk<br>       description: SCSI Disk<br>       physical id: 0.0.0<br>       bus info: scsi@4:0.0.0<br>       logical name: /dev/sdb<br>       size: 492MiB (515MB)<br>       capabilities: partitioned partitioned:dos<br>       configuration: signature=795b8ead</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Compact Flash card I am using provides more than enough information about its location <strong>/dev/sda</strong>. With that information in mind we can continue to the second step of this tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-search-for-bad-blocks"><a href="#Let’s-search-for-bad-blocks" class="headerlink" title="Let’s search for bad blocks"></a>Let’s search for bad blocks</h2><p>The command is very simple to understand <strong>badblocks -options /target_drive</strong>. The graphic below should help explain the meaning of the parameters. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/vWirLxtJ6mH2DrMIOJ3cRA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TJVgkV3hR7I/AAAAAAAACgQ/ksAx-RunEnk/s800/badblocks_parameter.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="Result"><a href="#Result" class="headerlink" title="Result"></a>Result</h2><p>From the output below you can see that badblocks checks every block from 0 all the way to 3727079.</p>
<p>root@PartedMagic:~# badblocks -nvs /dev/sda<br>Checking for bad blocks in non-destructive read-write mode<br>From block 0 to 3727079<br>Checking for bad blocks (non-destructive read-write test)<br>Testing with random pattern: done<br>Pass completed, 0 bad blocks found.</p>
<p>After three months of use my 4GB Kingston Compact Flash card is performing like expected with zero bad blocks. If you plan on doing a full installation on a Compact Flash then you should use badblocks to monitor the health of the Compact Flash over time. Remember to unmount the drive you wish to scan with badblocks.</p>
<h2 id="Video"><a href="#Video" class="headerlink" title="Video"></a>Video</h2><p>I also made a video of the process. </p>

      <p>Windows Explorer does a great job of moving small files, however the same cannot be said about large file transfers. The process of copying takes longer than it should. When moving or transferring files you run the risk of corrupting them, combined with the fact that Windows Explorer may not alert you of a mismatch you may be looking at trouble. Also, in the case of terminated transfer you may have to transfer the entire file all over again and waste valuable time, problems like this can be painful on files ranging in the tens of Gigabytes or even higher. To overcome this limitations you should consider using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php">TeraCopy</a>. Think of TeraCopy as a smart way of transferring files, by using TeraCopy you can expect to: <img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TJMdq3bi73I/AAAAAAAACf4/HrNBkKjgc8E/s800/teracopy_main.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Copy files faster. TeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce seek times. Asynchronous copy speeds up file transfer between two physical hard drives.</li>
<li>Pause and resume file transfers. Pause copy process at any time to free up system resources and continue with a single click.</li>
<li>Error recovery. In case of copy error, TeraCopy will try several times and in the worse case just skip the file, not terminating the entire transfer.</li>
<li>Interactive file list. TeraCopy shows failed file transfers and lets you fix the problem and recopy only problem files.</li>
<li>Shell integration. TeraCopy can completely replace Explorer copy and move functions, allowing you work with files as usual.</li>
<li>Full Unicode support.</li>
<li>Windows 7 x64 support.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In my not-so scientific test TeraCopy transferred a total of 9.28GB in a total time 2:53.59 minutes, while Windows Explorer took 3:41.49 to move the same amount of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it doesn’t hurt to have TeraCopy verify the checksum of the transferred files. <img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TJMdrp74YLI/AAAAAAAACf8/xfEVd9HY5ZE/s800/teracopy_verify.png"> Integrates nicely with Windows for convenience. <img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TJMclooTRRI/AAAAAAAACfo/ru4J0DqxNbk/s800/teracopy_windows_intergration.png"> While my test was minimal the value of TeraCopy becomes evident when moving large amounts of data between drives, not using a smart solution like TeraCopy can be a painful and wasteful experience. TeraCopy is available at no cost for home use and is also available in the form of a paid version that includes other features like support.</p>

      <p>It would be safe to assume that PDF or Portable Document Format is a convenient and widely supported format, specially if you wish to distribute documents that don’t have to be edited. The problem is that not all applications support exporting or printing to the PDF format natively. While plenty of online services will happily covert documents to other formats they usually come with inconveniences and the result may not look professional when a document is watermarked with the name of a third party. Meet <strong>CutePDF Writer</strong> a printer subsystem or in simple terms “CutePDF Writer is a plug-in that appears as if it was a printer, instead of a paper copy the result will be a PDF”, applications only have to support printing in order to use CutePDF Writer. When the subsytem is installed you can choose between printing to a regular printer or CutePDF Writer. CutePDF Writer has several advantages over online PDF convertion services like:</p>
<ul>
<li>No unwanted watermaks or ads on the resulting files</li>
<li>No unecessary conversion from say .doc to PDF, output directly to PDF</li>
<li>No need to modify local applications</li>
<li>No limits on how much or what you print, privacy is in your hands</li>
<li>Free for commercial and non-commercial use</li>
</ul>
<p>To start using the subsystem first you need to go over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp">cutepdf.com</a> and download CutePDF Writer <em>CuteWriter.exe</em> and optionally the free PDF coverter <em>coverter.exe</em>. I say optionally because CuteWriter.exe alone has the capability of downloading converter.exe over the Internet and install it for you. However, if you do not expect to be near an Internet connection you should download both files. <img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TG3UrslGnrI/AAAAAAAACds/9b33pHlkqfg/s800/cute_screen.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ghostscript is an example of a PS2PDF, its a must if you wish to output file in to PDF</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the download in complete, double click on <strong>CuteWriter.exe</strong> to start the installer. Begin the installation by clicking on the <strong>Install</strong> button. <img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TGudds9rknI/AAAAAAAACck/UHdKqyLTI-Q/s800/1.png"> Since the CutePDF Writer installer did not find any sings of a PS2PDF on the system you are being given the option to automatically download and install <em>coverter.exe</em> for you. Click on <strong>Yes</strong> to install coverter.exe on the system. <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TGuddjTasFI/AAAAAAAACco/RDjfx3rshZI/s800/2.png"> Internet connection required, allow some time for the download to complete. <img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/TGudd7JjGzI/AAAAAAAACcs/eFA0vbIyR14/s800/3.png"> When CutePDF Writer and all of the components are installed you will be presented with a page in your browser explaining how to use it.

      <p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/call-phones-from-gmail.html">blog post Google announced</a> that Gmail will now integrate support for VOIP, the service will continue to provide free calling to countries like the United States and Canada, calling rates for other countries will vary (U.K., France, Germany, China, Japan pay $0.02 a minute). <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/THXraaTxmbI/AAAAAAAACeA/pPYq_E7k0EA/s800/screenshot2.jpeg" title="Google Voice"> However, Google Apps users and non-US users will have to wait longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that most of us don’t spend all day in front of our computers, we thought, “wouldn’t it be nice if you could call people directly on their phones?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to be able to use the new service users will need to install the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.gmail.com/call">Voice and video plug-in</a> before using it. The service is expected to become functional over the next few days. The most important aspect of this announcement is the convenient user experience, while raising questions on how much of your personal information Google now manages.</p>

      <p><strong>Q) I have a brand new Ubuntu Server installation with port 22(SSH) facing the Internet, while looking at the logs I noticed that no information such as failed log-in attempts are being logged. What file and parameter do I need to change in order to start logging failed attempts?.</strong> <strong>A)</strong> by default OpenSSH on Ubuntu is not set to log failed log-in attempts, I guess the logic behind this decision is to reduce the amount of logs being generated. The risk associated with not logging failed attempts is that you will never know if your server is being targeted by the bad guys, pretty much anything exposed to the Internet is bound to be a target of some sort.</p>
<h2 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h2><p>In order to start logging failed attempts you need root, a text editor, and access to the <em>sshd_config</em> file. Open the file <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em> with your favorite editor.</p>
<p>nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</p>
<p>And look for the line starting with <em>#Logging</em> and change the parameter from <em>LogLevel INFO</em> to <em>LogLevel VERBOSE</em>.</p>
<p># Logging<br>SyslogFacility AUTH<br>LogLevel INFO</p>
<p>The new configuration should look like this:</p>
<p># Logging<br>SyslogFacility AUTH<br>LogLevel VERBOSE</p>
<p>From now on the system will log all failed attempts to <em>/var/log/auth.log</em>. Just don’t be surprised about your popularity with the bad guys!.</p>
