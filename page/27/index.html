      <p>I do not blog that much about the software on my desktop but this time I had to write about the cross platform game <em>World of Goo</em> (Linux, Windows and Mac) by 2D Boy. The game consist of creating geometric structures of all shapes and sizes like bridges and towers in order to reach or circle around an existing structure while using balls of goo. Of course you have to take into consideration factors like stability, proper weight distribution, and the strength of the structure without using too many balls of goo. While at the same you have to collect more balls of using the existing balls of goo. If you like Lego then the game will feel familiar in no time. What can I say, whenever I see balls of goo in the street I see them differently, now I want to stack them.</p>
<h4 id="Let-the-video-explain"><a href="#Let-the-video-explain" class="headerlink" title="Let the video explain"></a>Let the video explain</h4><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x72eqm_world-of-goo-trailer-2-directors-cu_videogames">World of Goo Trailer 2 Director’s Cut</a></strong><br><em>Uploaded by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/2dboy">2dboy</a></em></p>
<h4 id="Excerpt-from-Wikipedia"><a href="#Excerpt-from-Wikipedia" class="headerlink" title="Excerpt from Wikipedia"></a>Excerpt from Wikipedia</h4><blockquote>
<p>The game is built around the idea of creating large structures using balls of goo. It is based on the prototype game Tower of Goo developed for Kyle Gabler’s rapid game prototyping Experimental Gameplay Project.[9] The game is divided into five chapters, each containing several levels. Each level has its own graphic and musical theme, giving it unique atmosphere.[5] There is also a bonus meta-game called World of Goo Corporation, where the objective is to build the highest tower using goo balls which the player collected through the course of the game. Players from all over the world can compete, as the height of the tower and number of goo balls used are being constantly uploaded to the 2D Boy server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, if that’s not enough the creators of the game offer a demo with the complete first chapter of the game with no limitations. To me that says how confident they are about the quality of the game. Give it a try, you will be buying the full game in no time. Hopefully you do not suck at puzzles. <strong>Links</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.worldofgoo.com/">World of Goo home page</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://2dboy.com/">2D Boy home page</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo">Wikipedia entry for World of Goo</a></p>

      <p>If you have ever manage network devices over long distance or even in a local area network you might want to keep an eye on the health of the network and the links they operate on. That’s a very good reason for using <strong>SmokePing</strong> on the network, SmokePing can graph over time the latency experienced by the probe. In the long run network monitoring can help identify trouble points or areas of interest. If you are paying for a T1 then you should get your moneys worth. There is nothing worse than having little or no data to troubleshoot network problems.</p>
<h4 id="SmokePing-overview"><a href="#SmokePing-overview" class="headerlink" title="SmokePing overview"></a>SmokePing overview</h4><p>SmokePing generates graphs over time that show vital network information about the quality of the selected link being monitored by the probe. SmokePing can be easily configured to monitor multiple sites at the same time and show the specific time in which the link experienced unusual activity. It’s common knowledge that high latency will result on poor network performance. Prior to the installation you should have a full functional web server installed.</p>
<h4 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h4><ul>
<li>Monitor the latency of the OpenDNS servers and make an informed decision on whether they are or not in your best interest.</li>
<li>Monitor links from the central office to the remote office. Constant and unusual high levels of latency may indicate a problem with the ISP.</li>
<li>Servers become unreachable during certain periods of the day. With the data log by the probe you can pin point the time of failure (disconnection).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="SmokePing-installation-on-Ubuntu"><a href="#SmokePing-installation-on-Ubuntu" class="headerlink" title="SmokePing installation on Ubuntu"></a>SmokePing installation on Ubuntu</h4><p>SmokePing is available in the Ubuntu repositories. For Debian based Distributions you can use Apt-Get, installation may depend on you distribution.</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install smokeping</p>
<h4 id="SmokePing-configuration"><a href="#SmokePing-configuration" class="headerlink" title="SmokePing configuration"></a>SmokePing configuration</h4><p>The configuration file is located at <strong>/etc/smokeping/config</strong>. The configuration file I am using is organised to monitor two separate sites with multiple hosts. In real life this examples would represent the local site and the remote site. Copy of <a href="/download/code/config">SmokePing configuration file</a>. Open and edit.</p>
<p>sudo nano /etc/smokeping/config</p>
<p>To get SmokePing started let’s edit some of the basic options. I hope this is somewhat self explanatory, change the following values to match your server values.</p>
<ul>
<li>owner and contact</li>
<li>cgiurl</li>
<li>mailhost</li>
<li>to</li>
<li>from</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/SYPWE44LKfI/AAAAAAAAAa8/hDqzUnuQssY/s800/serv_config.png"> Remember what I said about monitoring two separate sites, well one is the local area network (NETWORK1) and the other monitors colocated servers (NETWORK2). You can see the hierarchy “+++” represents the target host. Make changes as you see fit. In this case I am monitoring three network devices. Change the hostname to match your own, enter the IP address or domain name of the devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>++ NETWORK1 (Name of the network)</li>
<li>+++ LAN_ROUTER (Target host)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/SYPWFDbRhKI/AAAAAAAAAbE/pYiG4lGdXX0/s800/loc_site.png"> Same can be said about the second example (NETWORK2), again three network devices are being monitored. <img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/SYPWFDCTYrI/AAAAAAAAAbM/RrCtGVs8bto/s800/rem_site.png"> After you are done with the changes save and restart SmokePing.</p>
<p>/etc/init.d/smokeping restart</p>
<p>Open your browser and go to the following address.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi">http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi</a></p>
<p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_fF0LO28FGYY/SYdrDwDT-sI/AAAAAAAAAbs/nAJhYn7rQA0/s800/smokeping_resize.png"> Give SmokePing some time to log the data. Try to experiment with the configuration file, but all try to keep the target host’s organized.</p>

      <p>You may be familiar with OpenSSL and how it’s used to encrypt web pages across the internet, however it can also be used to encrypt files on systems. Lucky you OpenSSL is available on pretty much any operating system you can think of, meaning that if you need quick encryption there is no better option. An alternative to OpenSSL is GPG however it’s not included by default on all distributions. I find that encrypting files with GPG requires less manual input. If you are interested in encrypting files with GPG instead of OpenSSL then read this article <a href="http://linhost.info/2009/02/encrypt-files-with-gpg-on-linux/">Encrypt files with GPG</a>. To view the a list of the available ciphers issue the following command.</p>
<p>openssl -h</p>
<h4 id="OpenSSL-encryption-basics"><a href="#OpenSSL-encryption-basics" class="headerlink" title="OpenSSL encryption basics"></a>OpenSSL encryption basics</h4><p>The process to encrypt a file is not complex, all you need to remember is to specify the cipher to be used, indicate salt, the input file and output file. Here is the anatomy of the command.</p>
<p>openssl  cipher  -a  -in  -out</p>
<p>Explanation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cipher</strong> specify the cipher to be used.</li>
<li><strong>-a</strong> encrypted output will be base64 encoded, useful for sending the file via email.</li>
<li><strong>-salt</strong> used to complicate dictionary attacks, make the attackers job harder by doubling the amount of resources needed.</li>
<li><strong>-in</strong> input file, the file you want to encrypt.</li>
<li><strong>-out</strong> output, the encrypted file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="File-encryption"><a href="#File-encryption" class="headerlink" title="File encryption"></a>File encryption</h4><p>In the following example <strong>filename.pdf</strong> will encrypted using <strong>triple DES cipher</strong>. Because I want to remember the cipher used to encrypt the file the result was <strong>filename.des3</strong> indicating that triple DES was used on the file.</p>
<p>openssl des3 -a -salt -in filename.txt -out filename.des3</p>
<h4 id="File-decryption"><a href="#File-decryption" class="headerlink" title="File decryption"></a>File decryption</h4><p>To decrypt the file the process is similar. Indicate the cipher, file was base64 encoded, decrypt the file, input the file name and output the file name.</p>
<p>openssl des3 -a -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cipher</strong> indicate the used cipher</li>
<li><strong>-a</strong> encrypted file was encoded with base64.</li>
<li><strong>-d</strong> the file will decrypted</li>
<li><strong>-salt</strong> salt was used</li>
<li><strong>-in</strong> specyfile the encrypted file to be decrypted</li>
<li><strong>-out</strong> output file</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Experiment"><a href="#Experiment" class="headerlink" title="Experiment"></a>Experiment</h4><p>You don’t have to use triple DES to encrypt your files. Switching ciphers is very easy, in this case I decided to use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Encryption of the file.</p>
<p>openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in vim.pdf -out output.aes</p>
<p>Decryption of the file.</p>
<p>openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in input.aes -out output.pdf</p>
<p>Hopefully this article will help you secure your files from the unknown. <strong>Interesting sources</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/enc.html">OpenSSL docs</a></p>

      <p>Linux distributions among them Ubuntu include <strong>GPG</strong> which is used to encrypt files in a very simple and straight forward manner. The whole process for encrypting a file with GPG requires less manual input when compared to OpenSSL. Do not forget, there is no way to reset the password once a file has been encrypted without access the to original password. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">Excerpt from Wikipedia</a> <em>GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a free open source alternative to the PGP suite of cryptographic software. GnuPG is compliant with RFC 4880, which is the current IETF standards track specification of OpenPGP.</em></p>
<h4 id="How-to-use-GPG"><a href="#How-to-use-GPG" class="headerlink" title="How to use GPG"></a>How to use GPG</h4><p>To encrypt a file all you need to do is type <strong>gpg</strong>, followed by <strong>-c</strong> to encrypt with a symmetric cipher and the name of the file you want to encrypt.</p>
<p>gpg -c filename.pdf</p>
<p>Then you will be asked to provide a password for the encrypted file twice.</p>
<p>Enter passphrase: mypassword<br>Repeat passphrase: mypassword</p>
<p>The result will a file with the file extension ending in <strong>.gpg</strong>, for example <strong>filename.pdf</strong> becomes <strong>filename.pdf.gpg</strong> indicating the file has been encrypted with GPG.</p>
<h4 id="Decrypt-the-file"><a href="#Decrypt-the-file" class="headerlink" title="Decrypt the file"></a>Decrypt the file</h4><p>To decrypt the file the process is similar. Just type <strong>gpg</strong> and the file name, you will then be asked to provide the password for the encrypted file.</p>
<p>gpg filename.pdf.gpg</p>
<p>and provide the passphrase needed to decrypt the file.</p>
<p>Enter passphrase: mypassword</p>
<p>The file will now be decrypted and presented in it’s original format.</p>

      <p>If you ever find your self in need of changing or setting different parameters on a network interface then you need to install <strong>Ethtool</strong>. Basically you can set the duplex on a network interface and link speed among many other things. Do not dismiss Ethtool, I have found it to be useful for configuring Linux devices that need to be linked to legacy networking devices or some network related funkiness that results in auto-negotiation not working. In order to use Ethtool you need to have root. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ethtool8.html">Ethtool man page</a></p>
<h4 id="Basic-use"><a href="#Basic-use" class="headerlink" title="Basic use"></a>Basic use</h4><p>Ethtool can output detailed information about the NIC. Here you can see all the supported link modes and current settings.</p>
<p>ethtool eth0</p>
<p>Output.</p>
<p>Settings for eth0:<br>    Supported ports: [ TP MII ]<br>    Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full<br>                            100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full<br>    Supports auto-negotiation: Yes<br>    Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full<br>                            100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full<br>    Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes<br>    Speed: 100Mb/s<br>    Duplex: Full<br>    Port: MII<br>    PHYAD: 1<br>    Transceiver: internal<br>    Auto-negotiation: on<br>    Supports Wake-on: g<br>    Wake-on: g<br>    Current message level: 0x00000007 (7)<br>    Link detected: yes</p>
<h4 id="Tip"><a href="#Tip" class="headerlink" title="Tip"></a>Tip</h4><p>To display the available options use.</p>
<p>ethtool -h</p>
<p>Ethtool is by no means limited, but this are some of the common options I use.</p>
<ul>
<li>full speed <strong>10</strong> | <strong>100</strong> | <strong>1000</strong></li>
<li>duplex <strong>half</strong> | <strong>full</strong></li>
<li>autoneg <strong>on</strong> | <strong>off</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Working-examples"><a href="#Working-examples" class="headerlink" title="Working examples"></a>Working examples</h4><p>Some networking devices have a difficult time auto-negotiating with other network devices, mostly legacy devices that only support half duplex like hubs. On this example eth0 is configured to work at <strong>half duplex</strong> and turn <strong>auto-negotiation off</strong>.</p>
<p>ethtool -s eth0 duplex half autoneg off</p>
<p>In this example the interface is force to work at <strong>full duplex</strong>, turn <strong>auto-negotiation</strong> off and set the <strong>speed</strong> to 1000 Mb/s.</p>
<p>ethtool -s eth0 duplex full speed 1000 autoneg off</p>
<p>Ethtool is by no means difficult to use, it’s mostly about matching the desired settings. I recommend you click the link located at the top of the article to to learn more about Ethtool.</p>

<p>My opposition to DRM is not that of a liberal or a pirate, rather my opposition against DRM originates from the multiple attempts by large of media companies that have failed to deliver a working product. DRM is nothing but a botched attempt by the media companies to control the content they willingly sold to the consumer. In it’s very nature DRM is a violation of the consumer’s right by restricting how the content can be used. Do not get the impression I support piracy, in fact it’s clear to me that distributing copies of copyrighted content outside of the agreement is wrong. How ever, I do not support agreements that are based on “my way or the highway”. DRM supporters among them Microsoft are the clear example of no matter how much effort or big the corporation in charge of developing and implementing DRM can still be a failure. There is very little that can be done when the idea behind the effort is fundamentally flawed beyond repair. The giant corporations run by 19th century executives are also responsible for making any, any, and I mean any right protection technology fail. Executives do not understand that in order to sell they have to put their content on the market first, instead they opt to devote most of their effort to control the content. This is the BitTorrent side effect, one can find most TV show on a torrent rather than on a content provider site. You tell me which one sounds logical. For those who still support DRM or any technology that even resembles the same idea let me exposed to you the following scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Media companies only expect to sell their content not maintain it. Meaning the company has no incentive to keep the DRM servers or any support infrastructure running for say 4 years after the purchase date. Now, if the company experiences economic problems the first thing they will do is to cut unnecessary expenses, one of them will be the 4 year old DRM infrastructure. They have no legal obligation to maintain or support the infrastructure.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies seek profit then why should they maintain such technology in the first place. It used be that when you buy something there was an agreement where you agree to pay for the content which then entitled you to ownership for personal use. Well, that’s the past because DRM means you the consumer had to first pay full price, then enter an agreement where the product is not even guaranteed to be there in the future. I have yet to find a compelling argument in favor of DRM other than the same poorly though of argument of protection. Challenge my position, I dare you?. <strong>Interesting sources</strong></p>

      <p>True story, a long time ago a small IT department made some changes of personal one of them was the person in charge of the servers. Due to poor administration and organization there was no real documentation of the network and what it was supposed to do. Among the problems found after the change was that none of the racks were labeled or any of the networks device they stored labeled. The new team had to manually log in to every device to see what they were doing. The routers and switches were the first ones to be identified. However it was a very different to story when it came time to identifying the 56 identical 1U servers and 6 4U SAN’s. Rebooting each server meant down time and an impractical approach. Well, the servers happen to run Linux and one useful tool usually used for setting the duplex on network interfaces came to mind, Ethtool. <strong>Note: you may need to install Ethtool</strong> The solution did not involved down time, but a hands on approach. Ethtool was used to instruct the NIC to flash it’s LED for 5 seconds in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>ethtool -p eth0 5</p>
<p>Let me explain, Ethool will tell the NIC LED on eth0 to flash for 5 seconds. You can change that to a higher number. 30 minutes later and a lot of server watching resulted in proper labeling of every server. Some people need to learn how to use a spread sheet.</p>

      <p>Consider this to be a crash course on <strong>How To</strong> use Wget. <strong>Wget</strong> is by far the best (intelligent) download manager ever created for the common client server protocols on the web (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP). The amount of configuration options offered by Wget is so immense that the use of the command line may be necessary in some cases. Here is a list of useful Wget commands. Ports of Wget for other platforms exist, if you want to see more configuration option open the terminal and use.</p>
<p>wget -help</p>
<h4 id="Basic-use"><a href="#Basic-use" class="headerlink" title="Basic use"></a>Basic use</h4><p>The simplest command Wget can offer. This will download the the file movie.mp4 from domain.com, notice how the the protocol HTTP had to specified can be changed for FTP.</p>
<p>wget <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://domain.com/movie.mp4">http://domain.com/movie.mp4</a></p>
<h4 id="Resume-interrupted-download"><a href="#Resume-interrupted-download" class="headerlink" title="Resume interrupted download"></a>Resume interrupted download</h4><p>Let’s say you are downloading a 2 GB file then Internet connection dies for some reason Wget only managed to download 1.5 GB out of the 2 GB. The <strong>-c</strong> option can be used to tell Wget to resume the partially downloaded file, no need to download again.</p>
<p>wget -c <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://domain.com/bigfile.iso">http://domain.com/bigfile.iso</a></p>
<h4 id="Mirror-a-site"><a href="#Mirror-a-site" class="headerlink" title="Mirror a site"></a>Mirror a site</h4><p>Mirror or make a copy of a web site with the <strong>-m</strong> option. Self explanatory.</p>
<p>wget -m <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://domain.com/">http://domain.com</a></p>
<h4 id="Bandwidth-throttling"><a href="#Bandwidth-throttling" class="headerlink" title="Bandwidth throttling"></a>Bandwidth throttling</h4><p>Not everybody has FIOS (not me) for those who for example share a DSL or ISDN line are some what limited in the amount of bandwidth they can spare. Wget provides a way to limit the amount of bandwidth used, basically you can limit how much bandwidth it can use.</p>
<p>wget –limit-rate=20k <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://domain.com/movie.mp4">http://domain.com/movie.mp4</a></p>
<h4 id="Increase-re-tries"><a href="#Increase-re-tries" class="headerlink" title="Increase re-tries"></a>Increase re-tries</h4><p>When dealing with an Internet connection that suffers from high latency resulting in long download times the downloads will likely fail to complete. Instead of letting the unknown happen raise the default amount of retries (20) to say 30. Hopefully this will give you a higher margin to complete the download.</p>
<p>wget –tries=45 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://domain.com/movie.mp4">http://domain.com/movie.mp4</a></p>
<h4 id="Disguised-as-a-web-browser"><a href="#Disguised-as-a-web-browser" class="headerlink" title="Disguised as a web browser"></a>Disguised as a web browser</h4><p>Some sites will not allow download managers alone to retrieve the files stored on their server, instead they expect to see a web browser like Mozilla or IE. Well this minor obstacle can be overcome by telling Wget to disguised it self as Mozilla to retrieve the file.</p>
<p>wget -c -U Mozilla <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://domain.com/movie.mp4">http://domain.com/movie.mp4</a></p>
<h4 id="Download-files-from-FTP-server"><a href="#Download-files-from-FTP-server" class="headerlink" title="Download files from FTP server"></a>Download files from FTP server</h4><p>To download the same file from a FTP server just change the protocol when issuing the Wget command.</p>
<p>wget <a href="ftp://domain.com/movie.mp4">ftp://domain.com/movie.mp4</a></p>
<p>Let’s say the site happens to be password protected, Wget allows the user to login with credentials.</p>
<p>wget <a href="ftp://username:password@domain.com/path/to/file">ftp://username:password@domain.com/path/to/file</a></p>
<p>Feel free to mix and match the options above nobody got any where by refusing to experiment.</p>

<p>Accidents happen for example a Flash drive that might have been accidentally formatted or certain files erased from a hard drive. The good news is that as long as the data is not overwritten there is a high margin for a successful recovery. After all the recycle bin is not a secure way of destroying data by any standards. For this article I will be using <strong>PhotoRec</strong> by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Main_Page">CG Security</a>, Photorec has many advantages for example it’s open source, cross platform, configurable and is relatively light while operating. The entire operation will take some time depending in size of the drive to be inspected. Do not expect the files to recovered with the original file name, instead Photorec will assign them a number. The output data should be stored on a second drive, don’t even think about about using the same drive. The recovery technique I use is called <strong>Data Carving</strong>, I’ll let the collective knowledge explain what it means. <em>Data Carving is a data recovery technique that allows for data with no file system allocation information to be extracted by identifying sectors and clusters belonging to the file. Data Carving usually searches through raw sectors looking for specific desired file signatures. The fact that there is no allocation information means that the investigator must specify a block size of data to carve out upon finding a matching file signature. This presents the challenge that the beginning of the file is still present and that there is (depending on how common the file signature is) a risk of many false hits. Also, data carving requires that the files recovered be located in sequential sectors (rather than fragmented) as there is no allocation information to point to fragmented file portions. This method can be time and resource intensive.</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_recovery">Excerpt from Wikipedia</a></p>
