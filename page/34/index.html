      <p><strong>Update - If your version of VMware Player or Server fails to start after a regular kernel upgrade you have to re-run the <a href="http://linhost.info/?p=124">“vmware-config.pl”</a>.</strong> <strong>Revised on Jun 20, 2008</strong> Download VMWare Player latest version which is 2.0.4 from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.vmware.com/download/player/">VMWare site</a> and choose “VMware Player 2.0.4 for Linux (.tar)”. I would recommend installing the development tools first</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo aptitude install build-essential linux-kernel-devel linux-headers-generic xinetd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the download is completed untar the VMware Player download using</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tar xzvf VMware-player-2.0.4-93057.i386.tar.gz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Move to the recently created directory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd vmware-player-distrib/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and install</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo ./vmware-install.pl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow and answer the configuration options like usual, when you are done start VMWare Player.</p>

      <p>Over the years I have become active in different forums and by different I mean beginner to intermediate level and often I get to witness somebody new to Linux with no previous experience of any kind trying to use a distribution like Backtrack only to find themselves with out any idea on how to use it then blame Linux for the inability. Linux in general has made great advances in providing a GUI but inside remains a command line based OS, which is a huge contrast when compared to Windows which provides a wizard for everything even simple tasks. Regardless of the Linux distribution it may require some level of user input to work around some of the problems created by proprietary software. I like to believe that the reason behind Linux existence is because some people want more that even themselves cant explain. I don’t want to insult anybody but first you have to learn and understand what it means to use Linux. If you cant set the IP address statically then you really need to research networking in general. There is no reason to use Backtrack for other than penetration testing, I know that cracking WEP seems cool but by doing so without the proper understanding and asking on a forum only proves you are lame. It’s an insult to use a tool with out understanding what is for. I guess my point can be proven by reading the reactions to threads asking for help in cracking the neighbors AP. This is the only time when I approve hostile reply s which later become a witch hunt. If you don’t know what file system backtrack uses then please back off. My conclusion is don’t insult others by wasting their time, do your research and only ask for help when doing legitimate research. If all you want to accomplish is crack the neighbors AP then don’t waste your time and others by asking such questions, instead grab a networking book or search for online resources. Before asking for help in a forum use Google If you have no other option then I recommend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://linuxforums.org/">Linuxforums.org</a></p>

      <p>This is some what strange for me but I feel the need to let every one know of my experience with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> for VPS hosting. Over the past five months I been hosting <a href="http://linhost.info/">Linhost.info</a> on slicehost, I got in back when there was a waiting line to use the Creme de la crème in hosting. I can’t say anything about their costumer service because I never had the need to contact them about any problem and thats a good thing in my opinion. Uptime has been impressive to say the least and is evident that they allocate the resources for every client. <a href="http://linhost.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/slicehost1.gif"><img src="http://linhost.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/slicehost1.gif" title="slicehost1"></a> Also I will let you know that I used over 140GB of bandwidth in the past month and a half, I was expecting an email saying “Quit it this isn’t P2P”. Any way so far nothing bad has happened, if you are looking for a reliable, honest and affordable VPS company then look no further Slicehost is the company for you . I will be renewing soon for another 3 months of service. 4/1/2008 I am still a customer.</p>

      <p>Not so long I manage to reach the point where I want to run Linux on every device I own, finally I am what others call an enthusiast. Back in 2007 I was looking for a mobile solution that made use of Linux and all the software associated. Palm had the solution I wanted in the form of the TX handheld, at the time Wi-Fi was the only attractive feature, but there was no Linux alternative to Garnet. Four months I found Opie (Open Source graphical user environment for PDA’s) It’s like I died and went to heaven (Linux heaven) everything I was looking for in Linux for a mobile device was there. Back to 2008 and I no longer feel like buying anything Palm if I do it would be like feeding and giving hope to the dinosaur of the PDA industry that by now should be extinct. And the feeling comes from the non-sense marketing Palm creates for it’s products, since 2005 the price for the TX has been at 300 dollars with the current competition the price should be below 150 dollars. They no longer have a significant share of the market or even trust in Garnet their own operating system. Apparently they have no problem in letting another operating system in their mobile devices like the Treo. I would love to see Palm become an open company that appeals to the Linux enthusiast at a reasonable price but I must be dreaming. To be honest a device like the Palm TX would not be able to compete with the new options that I have in mind for example the Nokia N800 and ASUS eee. The Nokia N800 and ASUS eee are completely different devices but manage to make the TX look like an inanimate object. Whether you want a touch screen or keyboard the options are now available at an affordable price. The ability to run Linux is now a reality on competent devices. Makes me wonder about Palm and their business strategy, they went from innovators to being the dinosaur of the industry. And that’s how I feel about Palm</p>

      <p>TrueCrypt is one of the best solution for file encryption in general and is open source. Recently the team in charge of TrueCrypt released TrueCrypt for Linux with a GUI previously the only way to use it was via CLI. If you use TrueCrypt for Windows you might notice that some of the features are missing in Linux, any way now you have the ability of mounting a TrueCrypt volume between platforms with out any major limitations. I use Kubuntu and Windows XP most of the time, this release is welcome. <em>At the time of the tutorial version 5.1a was available</em> <strong>Open the terminal and use the commands below</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>wget <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads/truecrypt-5.1a-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz">http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads/truecrypt-5.1a-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz</a> tar zxvf truecrypt-5.1a-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz cd truecrypt-5.0/ sudo dpkg -i truecrypt_5.1a-0_i386.deb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TrueCrypt is now installed to use it open the terminal or ALT-F2 and type “truecrypt”. The previous installation should work with most distributions, if you have any question just ask me.</p>

      <p>After reading several comments about the release of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.storm.net.nz/projects/16">Winlockpwn</a> I could not believe the amount of people who did not get the importance of the tool. In the past months several high profile cases involving unencrypted data that was either stolen or lost brought attention to the way data is managed. The answer to the the problem was whole disk encryption, encryption has been used in servers but rarely in mobile devices for example laptops. Usually the entire hard drive is encrypted by means of software, for the data to be decrypted a password needs to be entered before the the Operating System loads. Solutions like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> offer such protection, if a computer is lost or stolen the data in it would be protected. In order to crack the password in a Windows machine a reboot would be required at some point, which in turns triggers the encryption software to ask for a password, getting the password for the encryption software would be nearly impossible when compared to the Windows password. Winlockpwn brings the ability of accessing a password protected computer with out the need for a reboot, undermining the previous layer of protection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my scenario a laptop is about to be stolen by a competitor, they know the target uses whole disk encryption on all of their laptops, a laptop that ask for a password to decrypt the contents is useless to them. The goal is to acquire a laptop that is powered “on” with the encryption password previously entered, if Windows ask for a password Winlockpwn should solve the problem. This method is easier than pulling the RAM out of a system and freezing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This post is a reaction to the following comments.</strong> <em>or you could just download hirens boot cd and boot off of it and remove all passwords within seconds….. jeezus this seems like a lot of work just to get rid of a password.. hiren’s boot cd ftw!</em> <em>terrible…. rather use ophcrack or cain this is a piece of trash. firewire????? .000001% of computers have firewire and .000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% have a wire for it anyway. worthless hack.</em> <em>why would you want to waste your time with connecting to another pc or running disks to get around passwords on xp , jus got into safe mode and reset the password n reboot , sure thats damn site easier !!!</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.itradio.com.au/security/?p=61">Risky Business podcast had an exclusive interview with the creator of Winlockpwn Adam Boileau.</a></p>

      <p>This is a quick tutorial on installing VMware Player on Kubuntu Gutsy Gibbon same applies to Ubuntu Gutsy. For this tutorial I will be using VMware Player 2.0.2, I recommend downloading the tar.gz package. Go to the VMware website and download the latest VMware player for Linux,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.vmware.com/download/player/">http://www.vmware.com/download/player/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extrack the tar.gz package using (at the time of this tutorial the available version is 2.0.2)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tar xzvf Vmware-player-2.0.2-59824.i386.tar.gz cd vmware-player-distrib</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The package has been extracted, now we run the installation script</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo ./vmware-install.pl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the installation script starts you will be ask some questions, if you want the standard installation keep pressing ENTER. <img src="/download/images/cli.jpg" alt="clie"> Congratulations the installation is complete, in Kubuntu you will find VMware Player under System &gt; VMware Player. After VMware Player starts you will have to agree and accept EULA.</p>

      <p>Ignorant headlines like this one <strong>Sweden sues illegal download site</strong> are normal, its sad to see that popular sources of media classify and tag others with out any consideration. File sharing is apparently related to piracy, I would like to see some actual figures for damages caused by piracy instead of estimates. Instead of blaming P2P and projects like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://thepiratebay.org/">ThePirateBay.org</a> for piracy why don’t we all take a closer look at the people using those services with the intent of getting free copy righted material. That’s a bit hard right because they are your average person living regular life’s they don’t do or deal crack, steal cars and murder people, then why would they commit the crime of stealing according to some industries. The answer it’s in our own society its embedded and in all of us if the possibility to get something for free exist we use it, then file sharing becomes a reflection of our society and it’s values. <img src="http://static.thepiratebay.org/img/tpblogo_sm_ny.gif" alt="tpb"> The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">P2P</a> protocol is the only victim in all of this, because its been associated with free loaders according to some organizations if I am wrong they why is Comcast regulating only one protocol then, hey lets blame <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http">HTTP</a> for facilitating the distribution of child pornography. It makes me sad to think that people like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Stevens">Ted Steven</a> are dictating the laws, come on this people are clueless.

      <p>For those of us who use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a> for text editing will be happy to know that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> can use it as the default text editor. This might be old news for some of you but I just want to get the word out there, I have seen people download the text file first then open the text editor. Here is my simple tip on using Notepad++ in conjunction with FileZilla for easy text editing. This tip causes Notepad++ to start every time you want to edit a file by choosing the edit option in FileZilla.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install FileZilla and Notepad++ if you haven’t already</li>
<li>Open FileZilla and click on <strong>Edit</strong> (top bar) &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Remote file editing</strong></li>
<li>Now click on the <strong>Browse</strong> box, after the new window opens search for the folder <strong>Program Files</strong> open it and search again for the folder named <strong>Notepad++</strong> open it</li>
<li>Double click on the icon <strong>Notepad++</strong>, we are back in the menu now choose the option <strong>Always use default editor</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>, to test wheter you can edit a file using our set up upload a text file hover the mouse pointer above the file we wish to edit and do right click and choose the option <strong>View / Edit</strong>. If everything went well Notepad++ will open with the test file.<br>After saving the file FileZilla will ask if you want to upload the file back to the server answer yes.</li>
