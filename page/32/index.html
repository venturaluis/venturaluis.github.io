        <!--<p>The FCC pretty much gave Comcast a slap in the face and made it clear it has no right to interfere or restrict what protocols it’s clients request (no formal action taken yet). The whole time Comcast argued that throttling P2P was an effective way of reducing and controlling the network congestion created by this specific protocol. And so far we know what the FCC thinks of all this. The fact that the FCC agrees that ISP’s manipulating the protocols it’s wrong but also fails to prevent the trend by the big providers of placing bandwidth caps. Comcast is the shinning example of what the ISP’s really want which is full control over the network and what goes through the same network. The original plan called for</p>
<ul>
<li>Regaining control over the over subscribed lines</li>
<li>limit or restrict protocols that may be use for entertainment</li>
<li>place limits on the amount of bandwidth (prices won’t go down)</li>
<li>offer preferential services for a fee</li>
</ul>
<p>The amounts of bandwidth hungry applications has increased that’s a fact and the ISP’s have no intentions for upgrading the networks to meet the demands instead they want to treat bandwidth like a limited resource. The sad reality is that P2P offers a truly distributed medium with a lot of potential if optimized. Perhaps they could make use of the masses and redistribute the content at a local level. But controlling not optimizing the network is in their best interest, bandwidth caps are inevitable. I just would like to say that we live in the United States not in Australia meaning our traffic has no need to travel across the ocean to reach the country where most sites are hosted, so why should I be held to the same standards as the Australians?.</p>

    <div class="article-entry-abstract" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <!--<p>In this tutorial I will walk you through the installation of Subversion on Ubuntu, if you have never used Subversion before then you will find this tutorial easy to follow. Perhaps you should read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)">Subversion entry at Wikipedia</a> to find out more. Like any good system administrator our first priority should be to update and upgrade before installing SVN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s start by installing the Subversion package:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo apt-get install subversion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to create a central repository where our files will be stored. I chose /home/svn, Let’s use the svnadmin tool to create a path and set up the repository:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo svnadmin create /home/svn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now create a group in order to enable access to the Subversion repository. Create a group named using the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo addgroup svn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you add yourself to the newly group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo adduser user_name svn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This step needs to be repeated when giving access to a new user to the repository. After you have added yourself to the group, log out and log in to verify that you are an active member of the group. Now we need to enable access to the svn group and set the premissions to the repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo chgrp -R svn /home/svn sudo chmod -R g+rws /home/svn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to display information about the repository use the following command svn info file:///home/svn Well done, the reposity can be located at. <strong>file:///home/svn</strong> and <strong>file://localhost/home/svn</strong> For this tutorial all I need is local access.</p>
<h3 id="Install-Wordpress-via-SVN"><a href="#Install-Wordpress-via-SVN" class="headerlink" title="Install Wordpress via SVN"></a>Install Wordpress via SVN</h3><p>I find that installing Wordpress via SVN is far easier in the long run, this becomes evident when upgrading the installation at a later time. <strong>Overview of what we want to accomplish with SVN</strong> We want to install the current version for WordPress, create a directory “blog” for your blog install and then check out (Subversion command “co”), or extract from the repository, the version of WordPress you have requested. Here are the commands. First create a directory named “blog”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mkdir blog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Move to the new directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd blog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have SVN get the current Wordpress release and create the installation directories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ svn co <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.5.1">http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.5.1</a> .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do not forget the period at the end of the SVN command it makes sure the downloaded files end in the current directory, not including the dot will result in a new installation directory. After the download is complete, edit the wp-config.php with the required changes to complete the installation.</p>
<h3 id="Update-to-a-new-release-version"><a href="#Update-to-a-new-release-version" class="headerlink" title="Update to a new release version"></a>Update to a new release version</h3><p>When the Wordpress team releases a new version an upgrade will be required. Because we now use SVN all we need to do is log in to the server and use the “Switch” command to switch to the new version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd blog svn sw <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.5.1/">http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.5.1/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beautiful part of this process is that all custom and privately owned files will be left intact (example themes, plugins). Run the usual wp-admin/upgrade.php to finish the upgrade.</p>
<h3 id="TIP"><a href="#TIP" class="headerlink" title="TIP"></a>TIP</h3><p>Browse <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags">http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags</a> , to find all the versions of WordPress. Issuing two commands in order to set the automated upgrade process cuts down the amount of time and effort put into maintaining Wordpress. I hope you find SVN to be efficient and easy for Wordpress installations and upgrades than downloading, extracting, and uploading.</p>

        <!--<p>OpenDNS is one of the few revolutionary ideas to come out of a venture in along time that actually aims to fix a problem while being profitable at the same time. The service wants to replace the ISP provided DNS servers which have the job of resolving an IP addresses like 72.14.207.99 to Google.com. Why would I want to reinvent the wheel?, well some ISP’s for example Qwest tends to overload their own DNS which in turn make websites like Youtube.com load at a slower rate. Instead of maintaining different services for public use OpenDNS can focus on providing the best DNS available. Home user and businesses can make use of OpenDNS to prevent being tricked in to using a fake e commerce or banking sites, also web browsing can re restricted thanks to the filtering capabilities provided by category. OpenDNS offers this kind of protection at no cost. Your router or home computer can be configured with no knowledge of how DNS works. Even if your ISP DNS has no issues when it comes to speed you might want to give the service a try. <strong>OpenDNS corrections</strong> Some times we make the mistake of typing a URL with either a missing character or the character next to it, OpenDNS can sometimes correct that mistake and direct you to right address. However keep in mind the protection is not bullet proof and only top level domains name are corrected. <strong>Safer browsing</strong> The team in charge of OpenDNS decided to implemented anti-phishing in to every address they resolve to. When you try to visit a phishing site you will be redirected to a OpenDNS page warning you of the threat. The list used to judge if a site is involved in phishing activities is provided by PhishTank. Adult category filtering is provided by St. Bernard Software. Keep in mind that it’s normal to use third party listing services and OpenDNS is not responsible for what sites get listed. <strong>Lower response time</strong> Faster service is a somewhat debated feature and also the most heavily marketed one by OpenDNS. Whenever you make a request for a site OpenDNS will respond with the closest DNS server. DNS servers in general have large cache meaning they can store a large number of name resolutions instead of having to query the root name servers. Also the OpenDNS server might have a lower load making them respond to requests faster. For a fact I know that my ISP (Qwest Communications) who holds a monopoly in my service area tends to respond really slow to DNS request. The name OpenDNS has nothing to with open source but instead (I believe) with the fact that configurable and free access to better DNS is available to the masses. No features are forced on the users and the option to disable or enable features that you find relevant are given. I personally use OpenDNS on my home router a WRT54GL with the Tomato firmware with makes accommodations for OpenDNS integration, I don’t use the service just because it’s faster but because of the phishing protection which gives me some comfort. Hopefully you will find OpenDNS not only good for faster DNS resolving but also for handling inappropriate content or prevent becoming a victim of phishing. Think about the advantages of using such service versus what you might be loosing. Use OpenDNS while sober please.</p>

        <!--<p>I hate when my Netflix DVD rentals have to be returned right away because of scratches that render them unplayable. Technology has come along way from the fragile floppy or bulky VHS tapes to flat media capable of measuring millimeters in thickness, unfortunately some are conformist and believe that high density media comes in only one form factor CD &gt; DVD &gt; Blue ray. No, I wont argue against the storage capacity and cost of mass producing this type of storage media and the important delivery method it represents. Despite it’s greatness and all it remains vulnerable to scratches which are bound to happened in removable media and leave some of the data inaccessible. By now the industry should have released a new form factor smaller and more durable. In reality Blue Ray is the same pancake media but with bigger storage capacity is making headlines as the replacement for the DVD. I am an opponent of HDDVD and Blue ray because they represent a step back when it comes to removable media . The way I see the future is one where disks rule the world but remain impractical to be carried around in my pocket, perhaps the pancake will be rebranded. The only serious treat to physical media comes from digital transfers which have no need for physical media for example an iPod synchronizing with iTunes. But the challenge of a getting a computer and broadband connection makes it far from plausible for some people. Yeah, no real options!.</p>

        <!--<p>For higher education institutions learning a new programing language also means learning how to use an IDE, most preachers have their favorite for some reason. That’s when I noticed the environment around me after the class had to spend an unnecessary portion of the semester learning how to use the dam IDE and only to later learn how to get around it. Perhaps the intention was never to marginalize my learning status but sure it was accomplished thanks to the IDE and it’s preachers. I rather be productive than spend 15 minutes working on the tool thats supposed to help me. IDEs are just environments within another environment used to compensate for the lack of advance tools (rather necessary) in the same environment (confusing ha!). Are we really in such a position where the current and commonly integrated environments lack built in productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>An intelligent and efficient text editor</li>
<li>interpreter<br>or just get a Linux box</li>
</ul>
<p>This post was spurred after some hobo recommended me Erick Python IDE, keep in mind that my intention is not bash any IDE in general. This is my blog and it’s job it to reflect my views. IDE belongs on the Windows environment , post production hell.</p>

After researching the Banshee installation on my laptop I noticed one package was missing on my desktop installation. <strong>Podsleuth</strong> was the missing package and it’s job is to “discover detailed information about Apple iPod’s”. <a href="http://linhost.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/screenshot2.png"><img src="http://linhost.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/screenshot2-300x233.png" title="screenshot2"></a> All I needed was to install <strong>podsleuth</strong> using the Synaptic Package Manager. Why was the package missing in the first place I have no idea, but I hope this helps if your Banshee install fails to recognize or see your iPod.</p>

        <!--<p>“A phone represents part of your personality” some hobo told me the other day, well here is mine. In the beginning I wanted a phone with other (third party) software options Windows Mobile seem like the right choice, 5 months later I stopped buying 3rd party applications and just want it a phone. Then the Windows Mobile experience and performance made the rest of the time feel like I deserved some kind of mobile punishment. Remember “PALM” it was the same feeling. Some day a group of researchers will figure out how Microsoft approves a project for release. I bet some CrackBerry owner is making fun of me. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luisventura/2591995084/" title="This piece of crap makes me feel bad about my personality by luisventura, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2361/2591995084_fb83d1781d_m.jpg" alt="This piece of crap makes me feel bad about my personality"></a> <strong>Face it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interface sucks</li>
<li>The actual operating system under-performs</li>
<li>You get the whole Windows experience in your pocket</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t make the same mistake I made instead get a BlackBerry if you want to squeeze the most out of your time, but if you want a plain cool phone with a good amount of exiting features the iPhone is the answer. Sooner or later you will want a phone just a phone to make calls WM is not the option. Take it from me a sucker Luis Ventura</p>
